        We are going to draw a diagram, with as few words as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Start with a large piece of paper, draw a small bubble in the middle of the page, write “anxiety” in the bubble. The other page is for notes later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Around and close to our
        “anxiety” bubble, create and connect 3 more small bubbles for “body”, “stresses” and “coping”.

        We will need to practise this strategy to integrate it into our lives. Once it’s integrated, parts of it will
        become second nature.
    </p>
    <p>
        This strategy is not a quick fix; it should take a little while to understand. It aims to give a sense of
        constructive control and autonomy over the things we can change.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we try to write down our feelings and stresses, we may feel emotional. Crying is allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it may be difficult to write out our concerns. Other people may read our notes or we might not want to
        write something down. That is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are going to utilise an analysis technique that creates two extremes; internal/external, emotional/physical,
        thoughts/environment, good/bad. There are grey areas between each of those two extremes. We should not worry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The activity of writing down our feelings helps us to reflect on them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a plan for how to write down our feelings and how to think about them.

    <div class="section">
    <p>
        When we notice that we're experiencing a negative situation, the first useful questions to ask ourselves are.
    <ul class="quotes">
        <li>“Am I thirsty?”</li>
        <li>“Am I tired?”</li>
        <li>“Have I exercised?”</li>

    </p>
    <p>
        We relect on our basic needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we identify an immediate issue, we want to train ourselves to cope with these by developing small, repeatable, easy behaviours, in any small capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Repeatedly applying these new behaviours will give us a foundation of positive copying mechanisms.

        Some of the negative phenomenon require longer term plans. Setting longer plans will give you something to look forward to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Identify from your negative thoughts what it is that you could do to feel better in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        These goals should be achievable and simple.

        We can periodically take steps to achieve our goals. For example, finding a new job has many small steps, it
        is possible to spread those out and try to do one small step each week.

        Lots of little repeated efforts go a long way.

        Talking to people about our issues will help give them perspective.

        Language is very imprecise and limited.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often people will explain their emotions in the words and actions they choose to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding how we communicate can give us insights into our own thoughts and feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The overwhelming majority of how we communicate is via our body language; body language evolved first over a very long period of time, language evolved much later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most animals communicate with only their body language. The remaining part of our communication is through spoken and written
        language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider this example:
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
        “No-one is calling or texting me”
    </p>
    <p>
        The person using these words may feel lonely. They may attribute their sense of loneliness to other people’s
        deliberate lack of care. It is likely that the people in question are not intentionally
        non-communicative.
    </p>
    <p>
        How this helps:
    </p>
    <p>
        We can listen to what we say and do, we can think about the emotions we are expressing and we can use that to help us
        discover our own repetitive negative emotions, thoughts and behaviours. With practise, we can listen better to
        others.
    </p>
    <p>
        We make stories to explain our emotions to ourselves and others.
    </p>
    <p>
        What stories have we been telling ourselves about the world, ourselves and other people?
    </p>
    <p>
        TIP: At the start and end of the day, reflect on the things we've done to change our situation.
