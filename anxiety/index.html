        We will need to practise this strategy to integrate it into our lives. Once it’s integrated, parts of it will
        become second nature.
    </p>
    <p>
        This strategy is not a quick fix; it should take a little while to understand. It aims to give a sense of
        constructive control and autonomy over the things we can change.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we try to write down our feelings and stresses, we may feel emotional. Crying is allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it may be difficult to write out our concerns. Other people may read our notes or we might not want to
        write something down. That is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are going to utilise an analysis technique that creates two extremes; internal/external, emotional/physical,
        thoughts/environment, good/bad. There are grey areas between each of those two extremes. We should not worry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The activity of writing down our feelings helps us to reflect on them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a plan for how to write down our feelings and how to think about them.

        We are going to draw a diagram, with as few words as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Start with a large piece of paper, draw a small bubble in the middle of the page, write “anxiety” in the bubble.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create and connect 3 small bubbles for “body”, “stresses” and “coping”, keep them around and close to our
        “anxiety” bubble.

        Bad coping mechanisms often involve a health cost and spiralling negative behaviours,

        <li>
            “Talk to someone about their behaviour”
        </li>

            “Stop smoking”

        We can periodically take steps to achieve our goals. For example, finding a new job has many small steps, it
        is possible to spread those out and try to do one small step each week.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lots of repeated effort goes a long way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Talking to people about our issues will help give them perspective.

        Language is very imprecise and limited.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often people will explain their emotions in the words and actions they choose to use when they communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding how we communicate can give us insights into our thoughts and feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The overwhelming majority of how we communicate is via our body language; body language evolved first, language evolved later. Most
        animals communicate with only their body language. The remaining part of our communication is through spoken and written
        language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider these examples:
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
        “No-one is calling or texting me”
    </p>
    <p>
        The person using these words may feel lonely. They may attribute their sense of loneliness to other people’s
        deliberate lack of care. It is likely that the people in question are not intentionally
        non-communicative.
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
        “Humans got herpes from fucking animals, didn’t they?”
    </p>
    <p>
        This person is vocalising an obvious yet unspoken truth and seeking confirmation of the implied conclusions.
        The person sees other humans as sexually disgusting, this suggests some sexual trauma. The person probably has
        herpes and feels bad about it. There is a sense of injustice. The stated fact cannot be proven and does not
        support the implied conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
        How this helps:
    </p>
    <p>
        We can listen to what we say and do, we can think about the emotions we are expressing and we can use that to help us
        discover our own repetitive negative emotions, thoughts and behaviours. With practise, we can listen better to
        others.
    </p>
    <p>
        TIP: At the start and end of the day, reflect on the things we've done to change our situation.
